*Interpreting dummy variables and interactions* \hfill
*ARE212*: Section XX \\ \hline \bigskip

Simple example: suppose you're trying to figure out the wage effect of being married, being left-handed, and being married and left-handed. You would would want to run the following model:

$$ w_i = \alpha + \beta_1 D^1_i + \beta_2 D^2_i + \beta_3 D^1_i \times D^2_i + \varepsilon_i $$

Where $w_i$ is your wage, $D^1_i = 1$ if the person is married, and $D^2_i = 1$ if the person is left-handed. The easiest way to think about the interpretation of your mode is by considering considering what happens to the model about when you set the dummy variables to 1 or 0. \\

For example, suppose you wanted to get the average wage for un-married, right-handed people. This is the omitted category because $D^1_i = D^2_i = 0$. Plugging those two into our model gives that $w_i = \alpha$. So the average wage is just $\alpha$. \\

Next suppose you were interested in the average wage for married ($D^1_i = 1$), right-handed people ($D^2_i = 0$). Now we get that $w_i = \alpha + \beta_1$. Similarly, the average wage for unmarried ($D^1_i = 0$), left-handed ($D^2_i = 1$) people is $w_i = \alpha + \beta_2$. \\

Finally the average wage for married ($D^1_i = 1$), left-handed ($D^2_i = 1$) people is just the sum of all three: $w_i = \alpha + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$. \\

In table form, this can be summarized as:

| Description              | $D^1_i$ | $D^2_i$ | Average wage                          |
|--------------------------+---------+---------+---------------------------------------|
| Un-married, right-handed |       0 |       0 | $\alpha$                              |
| Married, right-handed    |       1 |       0 | $\alpha + \beta_1$                    |
| Unmarried, left-handed   |       0 |       1 | $\alpha + \beta_2$                    |
| Married, left-handed     |       1 |       1 | $\alpha + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ |

*Interpretation*

But what about interpreting the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta_j$ themselves? Following the discussion above, the following is hopefully logical:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha$: The average wage for the omitted category (unmarried, right-handed)
\item $\beta_1$: The difference in average wage for married vs. people who are not
\item $\beta_2$: The difference in average wage for left-handed vs. people who are not
\item $\beta_3$: The difference in average wage for married AND left-handed people vs. people who are not
\end{itemize}

The last one is the head-scratcher. The idea of the coefficients is that they're the effect of "turning on" the variable they're attached to. That doesn't have a lot of real-world meaning in some context --- it is difficult to "turn on" being left handed --- but it might be the easiest way to think about it.
