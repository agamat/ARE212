# run OLS
b <- OLS(y,X)

# we need the following to calculate the t statistic
n <- nrow(X)
k <- ncol(X)
e <- y - X %*% b
s2 <- t(e) %*% e / (n-k)
XpXinv <- solve(t(X) %*% X)
gamma <- matrix(c(0,0), ncol = 1)

# we can also calculate the standard error along the way
se <- matrix(sqrt(s2 * diag(XpXinv)),ncol=1)

# and now we can get our t stat
t <- (b - gamma) / se

# note on one-tailed vs. two-tailed
# good chance for class interaction

# Next do an F test
# Compare & graph regions?
