\textbf{Introduction to \texttt{R}} \hfill
\textbf{ARE212}: Section 01 \\

The objective of this section is to review the syllabus and to introduce the \texttt{R} environment. If there is remaining time, I'll work through some basic code puzzles that will require you to work in \texttt{R}, but will more likely leave them for you to play with on your own. Today may be a little slow for those of you with substantial experience in \texttt{R}, but I promise we'll speed up soon. \\

\textbf{Download \texttt{R}}: The download of \texttt{R} will vary by operating system, but it will begin here in any event:\\

\href{http://cran.r-project.org/}{\email{cran.r-project.org}} \\

The online documentation and installer routines are comprehensive. If you are new to \texttt{R}, then it might make sense to use the Mac or Windows distribution, along with the built-in editor to write and evaluate code. \texttt{Rstudio} is a popular IDE that provides a somewhat more user-friendly interface than the base \texttt{R} installation. For the tech-oriented, the Linux distribution is very flexible; and I'd use \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}{Emacs} with the \href{http://ess.r-project.org/}{ESS} package for editing.  If you are interested in using the Linux distribution and are having trouble with the setup, please see me. \\

I have included links to a few of the many resources on the web that provide gentle introductions to the \texttt{R} language. Those of you who have no experience with \texttt{R} or with programming in general will find it well worth your time to spend a few hours browsing those in your free time. In section, however, I will focus on presenting examples of code piece-by-piece in order to illustrate certain concepts. As always, please interrupt me with questions at any time. \\

\textbf{Working in \texttt{R}}

In order to download specific packages that are not bundled with the base distribution of \texttt{R}, such as the \texttt{foreign} package, you'll enter the following commands to install and load the package:

\begin{minted}[]{R}
install.packages("foreign")
library(foreign)
\end{minted}

Once \texttt{foreign} is loaded, you'll have access to all of its constituent functions, including \texttt{read.csv} which will convert a comma-separated value worksheet (.csv) into a data frame\footnote{Note that it is also possible to read in \texttt{xls}, \texttt{dta}, tab-delimited, and many other types of data using similar functions.}. We will do that now, loading into memory the \texttt{auto.csv} into a data frame called \texttt{data}.

\begin{minted}[]{R}
data <- read.csv("auto.csv", header=TRUE)
\end{minted}

We can read the names from the data set; but they aren't much help.
\begin{minted}[]{R}
names(data)
\end{minted}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "V1" "V2" "V3"
\end{verbatim}

We can replace the column headers with more descriptive variable names.

\begin{minted}[]{R}
names(data) <- c("price", "mpg", "weight")
\end{minted}

To get a sense of the data, list the first six observations:
\begin{minted}[]{R}
head(data)
\end{minted}

\begin{verbatim}
  price mpg weight
1  4099  22   2930
2  4749  17   3350
3  3799  22   2640
4  4816  20   3250
5  7827  15   4080
6  5788  18   3670
\end{verbatim}

With the columns appropriately named, we can refer to particular variables within the data set using the unique indexing in \texttt{R}, where data objects tend to be variants of lists and nested lists.

\begin{minted}[]{R}
head(data$mpg)
\end{minted}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 22 17 22 20 15 18
\end{verbatim}

Next week, we'll do more in-depth analysis of this data. \\

\textbf{Linear algebra puzzles}: These notes will provide a code illustration  of the Linear Algebra review in Chapter 1 of the lecture notes.  Don't worry if you can't solve these puzzles.  Come back to them  later, once we have gone over \texttt{R} code in more detail.  There are  many correct ways to solve these puzzles.  We will go over a few  solutions in section.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\id{5}$ be a $5 \times 5$ identity matrix.  Demonstrate that $\id{5}$ is symmetric and idempotent using simple functions in \texttt{R}.

\item Generate a $2 \times 2$ idempotent matrix $\X$, where $\X$ is not the identity matrix.  Demonstrate that $\X = \X\X$.

\item Generate two random variables, $\x$ and $\e$, of dimension $n = 100$ such that $\x, \e \sim N(0,1)$.  Generate a random variable $\y$ according to the data generating process $y_i = x_i + e_i$.  Show that if you regress $\y$ on $\x$ using the canned linear regression routine \texttt{lm()}, then you will get an estimate of the intercept $\beta_0$ and the coefficient on $\x$, $\beta_1$, such that $\beta_0 = 0$ and $\beta_1 = 1$.

\item Show that if $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_5$ are the eigenvectors of a $5 \times 5$ matrix $\A$, then $\mbox{tr}(\A) = \sum_{i=1}^5 \lambda_i$.
