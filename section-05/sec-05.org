*Empirical example: returns to education* \hfill
*ARE212*: Section 05 \\ \hline \bigskip

We'll start section with some brief comments on the problem set and a plug for =knitr=. Then, we'll look at the efficiency gains from a specialized case of generalized least squares using simulated data. Next we'll take one more crack at dummy variable intuition and talk briefly about interaction terms. With remaing time, we'll try out an empirical example to demonstrate the use of categorical dummies. Along the way, we'll apply some more advanced tools of the trade, in particular using =ggplot2= and exporting =R= tables in \LaTeX{} format.
* Problem set retrospective

In general, you guys did really well on the problem set. I've put the answer key on bSpace and will be handing your problem sets back today at the end of section. Many students found it useful to use \LaTeX{} and =knitr= (in =RStudio=) to format their assignments. This is great! The basic idea of =knitr= is that you can answer math or non-code questions using text or \LaTeX{} and then "knit" in your =R= code and/or results[fn:: =sweave= is similar --- in fact, =knitr= is an update of sorts to =sweave=.] in the same file; this means that you don't have to maintain separate files for your notes, results, and code. This process is a form of "Literate Programming"[fn:: A term coined originally by the computer scientist Donald Knuth], and it can be very useful for developing research ideas, collaborating on projects, and, of course, writing problem sets. If you're interested in learning how to use =knitr=, have a look at =ps1_answers.rnw= on bSpace --- it's the code Max and I used to generate the answer key.

* Efficiency gains from GLS

This section will briefly outline two general concepts, GLS and =ggplot=. We will examine the characteristics of generalized least squares (GLS), and specifically
the efficiency gains from a special case of GLS, weighted least squares (WLS). We will then recreate the graphs from Figures 2.6 and 2.7, roughly, in the notes using =ggplot2= a very popular graphing package in =R=. \\

Let $x \sim U(0,2000)$ and $\varepsilon \sim N(0,400 \cdot \frac{1}{100} x_i^2)$, where $\sigma^2$ = 400 and $w_i(x_i) = \frac{1}{100} x^2$.[fn:: Careful readers will note that putting some constants into $\sigma^2$ and other constants in $w_i(x_i)$ is totally arbitrary, since different choices in this regard will result in weighting matrices =C= that differ only by a constant multiple. Since these are weighting matrices, this will not change our result.]  The underlying data generating process in (2.102) is $y_i = \alpha + x_i \beta + \varepsilon_i$, where $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\beta = 1.5$.  The objective is to plot the simulated sampling distribution of the OLS estimator applied to $B = 1000$ draws, each of size $n = 1000$. After creating a slightly more complex OLS function that returns standard errors, we'll create our simulated population.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
set.seed(42)
OLS <- function(y,X) {
  n <- nrow(X); k <- ncol(X)
  b <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y; names(b) <- "Estimate"
  e <- y - X %*% b; s2 <- t(e) %*% e / (n - k); XpXinv <- solve(t(X) %*% X)
  se <- sqrt(s2 * diag(XpXinv)); names(se) <- "Std. Error"
  return(data.frame(b,se))
}

pop.n <- 1000000
sigma <- 400
pop.x <- runif(pop.n, min = 0, max = 2000)
pop.w <- (1/100) * pop.x^2
pop.eps <- rnorm(pop.n, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(sigma * pop.w))
pop.y <- 0.5 + pop.x*1.5 + pop.eps
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Note that since =rnorm()= takes the standard deviation as its third argument, so we pass it the root of the variance we want to generate. Now we'll pull 1000 observations at random from our population --- this is our sample. With these, we can calculate the standard OLS parameter vector $[\ah \hspace{6pt} \bh]^{\prime}$ by noting that $\X$ is just the $x$ vector bound to a column of ones.  We will only examine $\hat{\beta}$ for this section, rather than both parameters.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
n <- 1000
indices <- sample(1:pop.n,n,replace=F)
x <- pop.x[indices]
y <- pop.y[indices]
X <- cbind(1, x) # add an intercept

b <- OLS(y,X)[ , 1]
print(b[2])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 1.557292

The =sample()= function samples randomly from a vector, here without replacement. We create =x= by using requesting a randomly sampled set of indices from =pop.x=. Let's package this into a function, called =rnd.beta=, so that we can collect the OLS parameter for an arbitrary number of random samples.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
rnd.beta <- function(i) {
  indices <- sample(1:pop.n,n,replace=F)
  x <- pop.x[indices];  y <- pop.y[indices]
  X <- cbind(1, x) # add an intercept
  b <- OLS(y,X)[ , 1]
  return(b[2])
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Since there aren't any supplied arguments, the function will return an estimated $\bh$ from a different random sample for each call:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
rnd.beta()
rnd.beta()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 1.638114
: [1] 1.438083

We could do this in a =for= loop (like last time), but for pedagogical purposes and to be more =R=-ish, this time we'll use =sapply= to apply the function to a list of effective indices. Now replicating the process for $B$ draws is straightforward:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
B <- 1000
beta.vec <- sapply(1:B, rnd.beta)
head(beta.vec)
mean(beta.vec)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 1.574734 1.536203 1.594345 1.437183 1.399252 1.348865
: [1] 1.498432

All right.  Looking good.  The average of the simulated sample is much closer to $\beta$ than almost any individual call of =rnd.beta=, suggesting that the distribution of the simulated parameters will be unbiased.  Now, let's create another, similar function that returns the WLS estimates. Note that we follow the notes exactly in creating =C=, which is a diagonal matrix with $\frac{1}{\sqrt(w_i(x_i))} = \frac{1}{\sqrt(\frac{1}{100} x_i^2)} = \frac{10}{x_i}$ on the diagonals.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
rnd.wls.beta <- function(i) {
  indices <- sample(1:pop.n,n,replace=F)
  x <- pop.x[indices]
  y <- pop.y[indices]
  w <- pop.w[indices]
  C <- diag(1 / sqrt(w)) # equivalent to: C <- diag(10 / x)
  y.wt <- C %*% y
  X.wt <- C %*% cbind(1, x)
  b.wt <- OLS(y.wt,X.wt)[ , 1]
  return(b.wt[2])
}
wls.beta.vec <- sapply(1:B, rnd.wls.beta)
head(wls.beta.vec)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 1.175240 1.569361 1.340202 2.207822 0.821469 1.822597

\newpage
We now have two collections of parameter estimates, one based on OLS and another based on WLS.  It is straightforward to plot two separate histograms using =R='s core histogram plotting function =hist()=. However, we can use this to introduce a more flexible, powerful graphing package called =ggplot2=.

As in the notes, WLS is clearly the more efficient estimator.

* Interpreting dummy variables and interaction terms

Simple example: suppose you're trying to figure out the wage effect of being married, being left-handed, and being married and left-handed. You would would want to run the following model:

$$ w_i = \alpha + \beta_1 D^1_i + \beta_2 D^2_i + \beta_3 D^1_i \times D^2_i + \varepsilon_i $$

Where $w_i$ is your wage, $D^1_i = 1$ if the person is married, and $D^2_i = 1$ if the person is left-handed. The easiest way to think about the interpretation of your mode is by considering what happens to the estimated model about when you set the dummy variables to 1 or 0. \\

For example, suppose you were interested in the average wage for unmarried ($D^1_i = 0$), left-handed people ($D^2_i = 1$). The second and fourth terms in the RHS drop from the equation, giving that $w_i = \alpha + \beta_2 + \varepsilon_i$. Since we're interested in the average and since the error term is mean zero, we can infer that the average wage for this group is $\alpha + \beta_2$. We can do the same for other groups as follows:

| Group         | $D^1_i$ | $D^2_i$ | Average wage                          |
|--------------------------+---------+---------+---------------------------------------|
| Un-married, right-handed |       0 |       0 | $\alpha$                              |
| Married, right-handed    |       1 |       0 | $\alpha + \beta_1$                    |
| Unmarried, left-handed   |       0 |       1 | $\alpha + \beta_2$                    |
| Married, left-handed     |       1 |       1 | $\alpha + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ |

*Interpretation*

But what about interpreting the $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$ coefficients themselves? Perhaps the most intuitive way to think about them is that each one is the "effect" of turning on the associated dummy variable. Accordingly, the following is (hopefully) logical.

- $\alpha$: The average wage for the omitted category (unmarried, right-handed).
- $\beta_1$: The wage "effect" of being married /for right-handed people/.
- $\beta_2$: The wage "effect" of being left-handed /for unmarried people/.
- $\beta_3$: The wage "effect" of being *both* married and left-handed.

This is where my brain usually starts to hurt. If you just care about the wage "effect" of being married, then you're running the wrong regression, since this specification is designed to examine the heterogenous "effects". You could back out the average "effect" using the coefficients you have and the percentages of each population in your data, but it would be much easier to just run the specification without the interaction term. \\

*Why did you put effect in quotes?*

Unless our data is from a randomized control trial in which we randomly assigned marriage and left-handedness to our subject population[fn:: Sounds like a fun experiment.], the coefficients we estimate aren't true effects. With a run-of-the-mill observational data set, the coefficients just represent the correlation between wage and the dummy variables. \\
* Returns to education example

The purpose of this part of section is to estimate the returns to education using =R=. There is nothing causal about the results found here; but the empirical application gives us a chance to explore categorical dummies and to use =ggplot2= package again.  First, we load the required libraries.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
library(foreign)
library(xtable)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

We can then read the wage data directly from the online repository for the supplementary data sets for the Wooldridge (2002) text.  You will need an internet connection. We only need the =wage=, =educ=, and =age= variables, and we omit all observations with missing observations using =na.omit()=.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
f <- "http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/wooldridge/wage2.dta"
data <- read.dta(f)
data <- data[ , c("wage", "educ", "age")]
data <- na.omit(data)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

A quick visualization reveals the distribution of wages in the data set:

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inserts/fig1.png]]

Before we continue, I'll introduce the =%in%= operator, since we'll be using it shortly. The =%in%= operator generates a boolean vector[fn:: A boolean vector is a vector composed entirely of =TRUE= and/or =FALSE= values.], depending on whether or not the element in the variable that preceeds is contained within the variable that follows it. That's a confusing explanation. To make this more clear, here's an example:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
4:12 %in% 1:30
c(5:7) %in% c(1,1,2,3,5,8,13)
c("green","blue","red") %in% c("blue","green")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
: [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE
: [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

We can use =%in%= along with the =ifelse()= command to easily create dummy variables from variables that take on more than two values, like =educ=. We can now create a rough measure of educational attainment from the =educ= variable.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
e1 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 1:12, 1, 0)
e2 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 13:14, 1, 0)
e3 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 15:16, 1, 0)
e4 <- ifelse(data$educ %in% 17:999, 1, 0)
#+end_src

#+results:

The categorical education variables sum to one, and the =lm()= function will force-drop one of the variables.

I snuck in =xtable()= to format the output from =lm()=. =xtable()= outputs =R= data in a beautified \LaTeX{} table format, and it's sufficiently powerful to produce publication-quality tables[fn:: =stargazer= is an even more powerful package designed to create \LaTeX{} output.]. It works quite well for output from =lm()=, and we'll see soon that with some tweaks it will work for the output from our own =OLS()= function as well. \\

Note that the intercept in this regression reflects the mean wage of the =e4= class. The other coefficients reflect the wages of the other three classes relative to =e4=. What if we run the same model using =OLS()=?

We can show that the coefficients are just the average wage amongst each dummy group. Think of each dummy here as forming its own intercept. Since there are no other covariates, each captures the average wage for all of the observations in that group. We can also choose to omit a different group than group 4. Here, we can choose to drop dummy group 3 and to keep the intercept. What do the intercept and coefficients represent now?

It looks like age has a positive but diminishing effect on wage.  This makes sense, maybe, but the coefficients are not significantly different from zero.  Why might this be the case?  This is where some non-parametric graphing comes in handy.

* Puzzle (sort of)						   :noexport:

We will replicate the results of a sort of silly study that examines
the causes of McCarthyism, using a /path model/.  The study was
published in the /American Political Science Review/ by Gibson (1988)
and reprinted in Freedman (2009) to illustrate path models, which are
essentially a simple graphical framework to keep track of direct and
indirect causation.  The path model is recreated in Figure
(\ref{fig:path}), and shows that tolerance scores of both the masses
and elites directly impact repression.  This is a theoretical
framework.  The unlabeled connection between the tolerance nodes
indicates association rather than causation.  The repression and
tolerance scores have been standardized, so that they have mean equal
to zero and standard deviation equal to one.\\

The purpose of this exercise is to build up an intuition of the
relationship between the OLS estimates and covariate correlations.

\end{figure}

Gibson reports the correlation matrix for the path diagram:

|         | Masses | Elite | Repress |
|---------+--------+-------+---------|
| Masses  |   1.00 |  0.52 |   -0.26 |
| Elite   |   0.52 |  1.00 |   -0.42 |
| Repress |  -0.26 | -0.42 |    1.00 |

His model for political repression for $n = 36$ states is given by:
\begin{equation}
\var{repression} = \beta_1 \cdot \var{mass tolerance} + \beta_2 \cdot
\var{elite tolerance} + \epsilon,
\label{eq:one}
\end{equation} Denote $\var{mass tolerance}$ as $M$, $\var{elite
tolerance}$ as $E$, and $\var{repression}$ as $R$, such that Equation
(\ref{eq:one}) becomes $R = \beta_1 M + \beta_2 E + \epsilon$.  Finally,
let $\X = [M \hspace{8pt} E]$, so that $R = \X\beta + \epsilon$.  \\

Here is the kicker.  Since, all  variables were standardized, we know that
\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n E_i = 0 \qquad \and \qquad \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n E_i^2 = 1
\]

This is true, also, for $M$ and $R$.  Being careful about matrix
multiplication, we can compute the following:
\begin{equation}
\Xp\X = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\sumi M_i^2 & \sumi M_i E_i \\
\sumi M_i E_i & \sumi E_i^2  \\
\end{array}\right] =
n\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & r_{ME} \\
r_{ME} & 1
\end{array}
\right]=
n\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0.52 \\
0.52 & 1

We don't even need the actual data to compute the OLS coefficients!
Specifically, $\beta = (\Xp\X)^{-1}\Xp R$:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  n <- 36
  xtx <- n * matrix(c(1, 0.52, 0.52, 1), ncol = 2)
  xtr <- n * matrix(c(-0.26, -0.42), ncol = 1)
  (b <- solve(xtx) %*% xtr)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:             [,1]
: [1,] -0.05701754
: [2,] -0.39035088

Given standardized tolerance and repression scores, we can use the
following formula from page 85 in Freedman to calculate the model
variance: $\sigsh = 1 - \hat{\beta}_1^2 - \hat{\beta}_2^2 -
2\hat{\beta}_1\hat{\beta}_2 r_{ME}$

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  p <- 3
  (sigma.hat.sq <- (n / (n - p)) * (1 - b[1]^2 - b[2]^2 - 2 * b[1] * b[2] * 0.52))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 0.8958852

There is an implicit intercept, since the scores are standardized, so
that $p = 3$.  We compute the standard errors from the estimated
covariance matrix, $\sigsh(\Xp\X)^{-1}$.  Note that $\V(\hat{\beta}_k|\X)
= \sigsh(\Xp\X)_{kk}^{-1}$:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  vcov.mat <- sigma.hat.sq * solve(xtx)
  se1 <- sqrt(vcov.mat[1,1])
  se2 <- sqrt(vcov.mat[2,2])
  pt(b[1]/se1, n - p)
  pt(b[2]/se2, n - p)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 0.3797346
: [1] 0.02109715

The coefficient on $\var{mass tolerance}$ is not significant, but the
coefficient on $\var{elite tolerance}$ is significant.  But are the
two coefficients significantly different from each other?  Let $\Rb =
[1 \hspace{8pt} -1]$ and $\r = [0]$.  Then the following test
statistic will test that the two coefficients are equal.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F}
F = \frac{(\Rb \hat{\beta} - \r)^{\prime}[\Rb(\Xp\X)^{-1}\Rbp]^{-1}(\Rb \hat{\beta} - \r)}{\sigsh}
\end{equation}

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  R <- t(matrix(c(-1, 1))); r <- 0
  G <- R %*% b - r
  (F <- (G %*% R %*% solve(xtx) %*% t(R) %*% t(G))/sigma.hat.sq)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:            [,1]
: [1,] 0.01435461

The test statistic follows the $F$-distribution, and is not
significant at any reasonable $p$-value.  So, while $\var{elite
tolerance}$ may be significant in the regression of repression on
tolerance, it is not significantly different than the insignificant
variable $\var{mass tolerance}$.
